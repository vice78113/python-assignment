## Metadata Quality Checker

This repository contains a small Python program developed as part of the Data Stewardship certificate program (Module 2.5: IT Basics and Data Science).

The program supports basic metadata quality control for research data by checking a metadata CSV file for common issues such as missing values, incorrect date formats, invalid license information, and inconsistent filename conventions.

The idea for the program is based on practical experience in research data management support at the University of Vienna, including work with the institutional repository PHAIDRA.

## Functionality

The program performs the following checks for each metadata record:

- required metadata fields are present
- date values follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- license values belong to a predefined list of allowed licenses
- filenames follow a simple naming convention

The results are written to a new CSV file that includes an additional column listing all detected issues.

## Files

- `checker.py` – Python source code of the program
- `metadata.csv` – Example input file with metadata records
- `report.csv` – Example output file generated by the program
- `documentation.pdf` – Assignment documentation (requirements, design, tests)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (only Python standard library)

## Usage

1. Place `checker.py` and `metadata.csv` in the same directory.
2. Run the program.
3. The program generates report.csv and prints a short summary to the console.

## Context 

This program was developed for educational purposes as part of a university assignment and is intended as a simple example of metadata validation.

It is not designed for production use.
